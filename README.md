# ISN (Informatique et Science du Numérique) - june 2017
 This is a project that I've done for school with a classmate to take an exam of
the final exam for high school student in France, called the Baccalauréat.

## A Raspberry Pi arcade game console project

 The idea was to build an Arcade game console from scratch I found an old TV 
screen some wires, I had a **Raspberry Pi B+** and tools to build that with 
planks of wood.

First, we had to make drafts & schemes.
> See more in [this](game_console_design)directory.

Then we have to build it and think about a game, coded in python to do on it.
> The game will be a battleship game, and if you're interested about the building
  step of the project, see more [here](pictures/photos).

Finally, we had to code the game !
> See more just [here](source-code). :)

To pass the exam we had a report to do, see it [here](report.fr.pdf) (FRENCH),
and we had an individual oral recap of what they done.

**My final grade:** 20/20
